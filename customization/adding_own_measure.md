## Adding your own measures

The `mappers` folder contains `baseline.osw` which serves as a simulation input for URBANopt. It is a workflow of OpenStudio and URBANopt measures and dictates the sequence of running these measures. Measures are added to create building models and test different energy conservation measures for different scenarios.

- `set_run_period`: An OpenStudio Measure used to define the number of timesteps per hour and specify the begin and end date for running the simulation.

- `ChangeBuildingLocation`: An OpenStudio Measure used to load the EPW file and specify to the EPW weather file.

- [`create_bar_from_building_type_ratios`](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-model-articulation-gem/tree/develop/lib/measures/create_bar_from_building_type_ratios): An OpenStudio Model Articulation Measure used to create a core and perimeter bar sliced by space type. It takes in one or more building types as user arguments to create space type collections.

- [`create_typical_building_from_model 1`](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-model-articulation-gem/tree/develop/lib/measures/create_typical_building_from_model): An OpenStudio Model Articulation Measure that creates a custom prototype building with user-defined geometry and assigns constructions, schedules, internal loads, HVAC and other loads such as exterior lights and service water heating based on the space and sub space types. The `add_hvac` is set to `false` by default.

- [`blended_space_type_from_model`](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-model-articulation-gem/tree/develop/lib/measures/blended_space_type_from_model): An OpenStudio Model Articulation Measure that used is used to create a single space type that represents the loads and schedules of a collection of space types. It removes all previous space type assignments and hard assigns internal loads from spaces included in the building floor area. A blended space type will be created from the original internal loads and assigned at the building level.

- [`urban_geometry_creation`](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-geojson-gem/tree/develop/lib/measures/urban_geometry_creation):
  An URBANopt GeoJSON measure that is used to create geometry along with spaces for a particular building,
  accounting for surrounding buildings as shading.

- [`create_typical_building_from_model 2`](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-model-articulation-gem/tree/develop/lib/measures/create_typical_building_from_model): Added in the workflow after urban geometry creation and the `add_hvac` argument is now set to `true`, to add HVAC system for the blended space types. The rest of the arguments for adding constructions, space type, loads, etc. are set to `false`.

- `ReduceElectricEquipmentLoadsByPercentage`: An OpenStudio Measure that is used to reduce the equipment load by a certain amount. The measure is skipped for the baseline scenario. For the high efficiency scenario, the skip measure argument is set to false and the measure is implemented.

- `ReduceLightingLoadsByPercentage`: An OpenStudio Measure that is used to reduce the lighting load by a certain amount. The measure is skipped for the baseline scenario. For the high efficiency scenario, the skip measure argument is set to false and the measure is implemented.

- [`default_feature_reports`](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-scenario-gem/tree/develop/lib/measures/default_feature_reports): An URBANopt Scenario Measure that creates a `default_feature_reports.json` used by URBANopt Scenario Default Post Processor.

Additional measures can be added to the workflow by adding the measure name and directory name along with the measure arguments.
