[REopt Lite](https://reopt.nrel.gov/tool) is a technoeconomic decision making model for distributed energy resource (DER) deployment. Given a set of inputs it leverages mixed-integer linear programming to select the optimal design and dispatch of solar PV, storage, wind and diesel generator technologies - it also provides key economic metrics for the system. Integration of this model with URBANopt<sup>&trade;</sup> allows individual buildings (i.e Feature Reports) and collections of buildings (i.e. Scenario Reports) to be assessed for cost-optimal DER solutions.
