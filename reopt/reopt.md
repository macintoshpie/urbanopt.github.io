### Before you begin!

To run a project you will need an internet connection so the REopt Gem can access the REopt Lite API.

You'll also need an API key from the [NREL Developer Network](https://developer.nrel.gov/]). Copy and paste your key in to the _developer_nrel_key_._rb_ file in root directory of the urbanopt-example-reopt-project repo, then save the file:

    DEVELOPER_NREL_KEY = '<insert your key here>'
